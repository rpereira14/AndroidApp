# AndroidApp

This is my first experience with Android development.

This app aims to help a metal hardware store's sales team to manage and optimize their order system.

Now the app is ready to receive a costumer list with different parameters (like exclusive discounts), and a product list. The budget for the costumer is basically a shopping cart.

Functions to add:
- REST webservices
- Build a back office webapp for managment
- Integrate orders with inventory
...
